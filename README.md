## Description

In this project, I performed an end-to-end analysis of a Zomato restaurant dataset to extract actionable insights and support data-driven decision-making.

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Addressed missing and inconsistent values in key columns such as cuisine type, ratings, and cost for two.
- Standardized data formats to ensure consistency and accuracy.

### 2. Data Enrichment
- Added new fields such as country names from country codes and derived year/month from date columns to enable temporal analysis.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identified patterns in restaurant distribution, cuisine popularity, average costs, and ratings.
- Analyzed trends across countries and cities to identify high-demand areas.

### 4. Visualization & Reporting
- Created pivot tables, charts, and heatmaps to present trends clearly.
- Highlighted key insights such as the most popular cuisines, cities with the highest average ratings, and potential growth opportunities.

### 5. Outcome
- Provided actionable recommendations for business expansion and strategy optimization.
- Developed a comprehensive, structured, and reusable spreadsheet model for ongoing data analysis.
